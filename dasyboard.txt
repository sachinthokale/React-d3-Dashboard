Yes, exactly. A pie chart represents the distribution of topics based on their occurrence 
counts in the data. Each slice of the pie chart corresponds to a different topic, and the 
size of each slice is proportional to the number of times that topic appears in the dataset.

Additional Elements to Add
Interactive Features:

Hover Information: Display additional information (like intensity, likelihood, relevance) when hovering over each slice.
Click to Filter: Allow users to click on a slice to filter or drill down into more detailed data about that specific topic.
Color Customization:

Use distinct and meaningful colors for different topics to improve visual appeal and readability.
Annotations:

Add labels or annotations to highlight significant topics or trends.
Include percentage values on the slices for better clarity.
